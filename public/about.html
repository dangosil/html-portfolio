<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a student of Computer Science at <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://uenf.br/portal/">UENF,</a></strong> but I decided to change my course to Systems Analysis and Development in order to focus on what I really want, which is Front-End Web Development. </p>
<p>For now, I won't say much about myself until I've completed this new phase of my life. I'll try to update this site regularly.</p>
